# nationality-prediction-by-names-
Implemented a machine learning model using Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to predict nationalities based on names. Achieved an accuracy of 72.3%. The project involved data preprocessing, feature extraction from names, and training/testing the model to classify nationalities, demonstrating effective use of probabilistic classifiers in name-based categorization tasks.
